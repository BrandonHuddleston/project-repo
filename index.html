            <p>The Shiba Inu is a Japanese dog breed. There are six original distinct breeds of dog from Japan, and the Shiba Inu is the smallest one.</p>
            
            <p> largest in the group is the Akita. There arenâ€™t many red and white Akitas in the United States, but the few that I have seen, look just like larger versions of the red Shiba Inu.</p>
